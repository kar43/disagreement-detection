# Hierarchical Multitask Learning for Detecting News Content and Emotion Disagreements

 This project addresses the issue of automated news disagreement detection by introducing a method to compare texts for alignment or divergence. 
 The approach allows to compare news contents from different sources, aligning titles with article content, and identifying fake news through 
 comparisons with credible sources. 
 To address the complexity of news analysis, the project presents NewsDNet, a hierarchical multitask learning model that simultaneously detects 
 content and emotion disagreements. Content disagreement detection focuses on factual discrepancies, while emotion disagreement detection adds 
 a layer of understanding by considering emotional tones.
